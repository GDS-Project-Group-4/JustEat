In 19 minutes the average commuter cyclist could travel between 3.5 miles and 5.7 miles (bikecommuterhero), which could get you all the way out to Sightgill industrial park (5.4 miles). This commute by tram would take around 16 minutes (google maps), which is very comparable. If JustEat can promote businesses to incentivise workers to cycle to work rather than drive or take public transport this could really benefit the business.

These are popular as may students don't own bikes and use the bikes to travel from the station. Other popular start stations were located near to tourist destinations, such as; Cannonmills, Portobello, Dundee Terrace and Meadows East. The final few popular stations were located near to commercial areas such as; Charlotte Square, St Andrews square and Castle Street. \n",
